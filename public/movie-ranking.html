<h1>The Best Movies According to Sab</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>A Man Called Otto</h3>
<p>This is a great movie about frientship, love and acceptance for our neighbours</p>

<h3>Philadelphia Store </h3>
<p>There a 2 versions of this movie: black and white version with Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant and the musical version with Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby. I like the musical version for the songs but love the back and white version for Cary Grant - he's so damn dapper!</p>

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>I LOVED Barbie as a kid but I can't say I loved the movie - definitely wouldn't pay $16 to see in the theatre. Not sure what it was but . . . despite my confusion, I would definitely watch this movie again.</p>
